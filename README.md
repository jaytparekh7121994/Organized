Organized 

I have created a Python Automation Script that bifurcated your current directory according to its extension or suffix.
Division is as per below:
    Directory name : Extension 
    1. DOCUMENTS : .pdf, .rtf, .txt, .docx, .ppt, .pptx
    2. AUDIO : .m4a, .m4b, .mp3
    3. IMAGES : '.jpeg', .jpg and .png
    4. VIDEOS : .mp4, .mov, .avi
    5. COMPRESSED : .zip, .tgz, .gz, .rar
    6. EXE : .exe
    7. EXCEL SHEET : .xlsx, .xls

How to use ?
Simply just run "python Organized.py" on your destined Directory which you want to organize.
